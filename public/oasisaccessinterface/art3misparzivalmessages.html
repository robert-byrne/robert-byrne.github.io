<p><strong>Email to Parzival:</strong><br><br>Dear Parzival,<br><br>Congrats! See? You're famous now, just like I said. Although it looks likes we've both been thrust into the limelight. Kinda scary, eh?<br><br>Thanks for the tip about playing on the left side. You were right. Somehow, that did the trick.But don't go thinking I owe you any favors, mister.:-)<br><br>The First gate was pretty wild, wasn't it? Not at all what I expected. It would have been cool if Halliday had given me the option to play Ally Sheedy instead, but what can you do?<br><br>This new riddle is a real head-scratcher, isn't it? I hope it doesn't take us another five years to decipher it.<br><br>Anyhow, I just wanted to say that it was an honor to meet you. I hope our paths cross again soon.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Art3mis<br><br>ps-Enjoy being #1 while you can, pal. It won't last long.<br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Email  from Parzival:</strong><br><br>Dear Art3mis,<br><br>Congratulations to you too. You weren't kidding. Competition clearly brings out the best in you.<br><br>You're welcome for the tip about playing on the left. You totally owe me a favor now.;-)<br><br>The new riddle is a cinch. I think I've already got it figured out, actually. What's the hold-up on your end?<br><br>It was an honor to meet you, too. If you ever feel like hanging out in a chat room, let me know.<br><br>MTFBWYA,<br><br>Parzival<br><br>ps-Are you challenging me? bring the pain, woman.<br><br><br></p>

<p>The OASIS is an innovation in Technology and Virtual Reality. The Oasis was created by James Halliday, who passed away about 5 years ago. However, his achievements and goals live on in the spirit of his employees at his company, Gregarious Simulation Systems (GSS). Formerly Gregarious Games, which was known for building unique and entertaining games, GSS now only has one service in use, its Flagship the OASIS. The OASIS is more than just a simple virtual reality simulation. Using the highly advanced OASIS consoles, a set of haptic gloves and a visor, the user is able to experience a world unlike any other. It incorporates many features found in common multiplayer games, but on a larger scale. Many of the older games that have existed over time can be found faithfully and accurately reproduced within the OASIS for users to play. The OASIS network is also capcable of transferring data at high speeds, and has almost completely replaced the more obsolete Internet. Users can now tap into the OASIS and get access to all the previous content from the old internet and more, but each piece of information is more interactive and engaging. This site was designed as an access place for users to access their accounts on non-OASIS consoles.</p>

This site was created as a book project for a school assignment. All aspects and characters within the OASIS are the property of the original author, Ernest Cline.]</p>
